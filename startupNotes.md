Y-Combinator gave these lectures, and these are available at https://startupclass.samaltman.com/
==================


Sam Altma(President of Y-Combinator) :- 
only 30% of the way. 

startups are different from normal companies. 

 Four areas to focus on 

1. Idea 2. Product
3. Team 4. Execution

All of them should be great. 

Dustin Moskovitz :- why to start a startup ?

1. Idea 

4. Great exection is the hardest 10 times harder than a good idea.


a bad idea is still a bad idea. Most great companies start with a great idea. Airbnb happened cause Brian chesky couldnt pay his rent. If it works out then you are going to work on this for 
10 years. 
Long term  thinking is important. 
Truly good ideas dont sound like worth stealing. 

The first version of the product should be simple and take over a very small market and then later expand from there. 
Think about the growth of the market and growth of the startup. Care more about the growth about the market. Amazon wouldnt have been amazon if the internet did not grow this much. 

Focus in small but rapidly growing markets. One of the characteristics of such a market is "customers are usuallt pretty desperate for a solution.". Think about where this is happening in this world. 


Why Now ?
======

Why start now, why couldnt it been done two years ago ? And why will two years in the future be too late ?  -- A great startup will have answer to this. 
It should not take more than a sentence to explain what you are doing.

It should be a clearly articulated vision with a small number of words. 

While you are a student 
	1. Think about new ideas.
	2. Meet potential cofounders.
Meeting other co-founders is a good idea. A lot of them.



Product
=======

Great Idea follows a Great Product which follows a Great Company. 



Make something that people want.
How to identify which economy is growing. Think about what people are using. Young people get old.

How to deal with burnout. 

1. Idea 
2. Product
3. Team 
4. Execute.

Early blow-ups are due to co-founder blow ups. Co-founder should be known to each other. 
Its still bad to be a solo founder. 
Almost all companies have two founders. 
Really need a technical co-founders.

Have small number of employees.

Airbnb spent 5 months to hire the first month.
Brian Chesky.


Its important for employees to come together at the time of crisis. 

Mediocre engineers do not build great companies.

In the early days you cant screw it up.
Best are through personal referral. 
Look outside the valley brutally competitve to hire in the valley. 

Are they smart, do they get things done, do i want to spend a lot of time around them ?
The very best way is to work with them.

First time founders are bad at interview. 

In interview ask what projects people have worked on. 
	
Also:

1. good communication skills
2. Maniacally determined.
3. Pass the animal test.
4. Would feel comfortable reporting to them.

Hire people with whom you are comfortable reporting to if the role be reversed. 

Enjoy working with them. 

Reduce equity with investors and try to give to employees as they are the ones who build the company. 

You've hired the best - now keep them around!

Give credit to the team for all the good stuff and take responsibilty for the bad stuff. 

Dan Ping talks about these things that motivate people to do great stuff. :- 

1. Work 
2. Autonomy
3. Autonomy master and purpose.

E. Fire fast. 

1. When an employee is not working.. if someone is getting everything wrong. 
2. Or Create office politics or persistently negative. 
3. Its completely toxic.

Be a teamwork together. 


When should co-founders decide on equity split ? 

Have vesting on the equity.

4. Execution 

Ideas are not worth anything, only execution adds values or what creates value. 

A big part of execution is just putting the effort. 

The CEO has five jobs :- 

1. Set the vision.
2. Raise money 
3. Evangelize
4. Hire and manage
5. Make sure the entire company executes.


Trick for great execution is to say no a lot like 97pc time. 


Most startups are not focused right 

No credits for making effort only for making something people want. 

Startups are not the best for work life balance. 
Sad reality.

small amount of work on the right thing makes a lot of difference. 

You have to be really intense. 

You have to have this relentless things. 
Move fast  


Every time you talk to them,
they've gotten new things done.


If everytime you talk they say they got a new thing done.. best data to predict the company would be successfull.


Can you get it done ? 

1. Intensity 
	1.1 Quick
	1.2 Do whatever it takes.
	1.3 Show up
	1.4 Dont give up
	1.5 Be courageous.

Just show up and get it done. 

Always keep momentum


Sales fix everything
==================
	When facebook growth slowed, mark formed a growth group. 
Boards can be considered as a forcing function.



Set an operating rhythm
======================	 
1. Shipping product.
2. Launching new features.
3. Reviewing/reporting and milestones

Dont let a company get down due to press. 


Dont spend more money than you have
==================================


In startup no one to trick. Stop looking for tricks. 

Working as manager in large company is boring. 

If you hire people you like then you can have a blind spot.
